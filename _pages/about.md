I am a Ph.D. candidate at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by [Sebastian Scherer](https://theairlab.org/team/sebastian/) and affiliated with the [AirLab](https://theairlab.org). I am currently collaborating with [Rocky Duan](http://rockyduan.com) and [Pieter Abbeel](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/) at Amazon Robotics FAR (Frontier AI & Robotics), as well as with [Guanya Shi](https://www.gshi.me) at Carnegie Mellon University. Previously, I have worked with [Abhinav Gupta](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~abhinavg/) at [Skild.ai](http://skild.ai), [Chen Wang](https://sairlab.org/chenw/) from the University at Buffalo, and [Jenny Geng](https://ari-psu.github.io/team/junyi_geng/) from Penn State. I received my B.Eng. in Computer Science and Engineering from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen in 2019.

I have an innate passion for advancing spatial AI to enhance robot autonomy. One specific area I focus on is creating generalized learning-based SLAM systems. Currently, engineers need to manually tune hyperparameters when applying these systems to new platforms, datasets, or sensors. I believe data-driven methods and uncertainty modeling are key to solving this problem. I hope that one day, SLAM will be fully automatedâ€”so much so that SLAM engineers like me will become unnecessary. (And I'll happily "fire" myself when that day comes! ðŸ˜‚)
