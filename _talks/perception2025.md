## Abstract

In our challenging and uncertain world, state estimation and perception are disrupted by illumination changes, dynamic objects, interruptions, and featureless environments. This talk presents our recent efforts to build generalizable perception systems by learning uncertainty and dynamics across sensing modalities. Instead of relying on manually tuned parameters and empirically designed models, we use data-driven approaches to capture uncertainty and dynamics that are complex and unpredictable, enabling robust performance in extreme scenarios. I will first introduce AirIMU, which uses a data-driven approach to capture the nonlinearity and uncertainty inherent in the IMU sensor model. Then, I will present AirIO, a learning-based inertial odometry system designed to improve observability and generalizability on unseen sequences. Finally, I will discuss MAC-VO, a stereo visual odometry framework that leverages learned matching uncertainty to enable robust state estimation and mapping. We demonstrate its effectiveness across multiple challenging environments without any parameter tuning. Together, these works demonstrate how learning-based perception can achieve reliable and adaptable state estimationâ€”from IMU to vision.
